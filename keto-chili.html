        <h2>Keto-Chili</h2>
        <p>
            This is my family's favorite chili recipe. I came across it a couple years
            ago when we tried the keto diet and this is the one recipe that we can't
            get enough of. I've modified it to our liking.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <section>

        <ol>
            <li>Brown hamburger meat and sausage</li>
            <li>Use a food processor to chop two  green bell peppers and one yellow onion.</li>
            <li>Measure the spices on a plate (so you can add easily when the hamburger is browned).</li>
            <li>Drain the fat off the browned hamburger into a bowl.
                <!-- () Red text -->(Do not throw away),
                Pour about half the drained fat back into the pot
                <!-- () Red text -->(over a cup of fat, I reused about half of that,
                a little over 1/2 cup this time), you could use all the fat, but it might make the chili too greasy.
            </li>
            <li>Add the spices you prepared into the pot with the meat and mix.</li>
            <li>Add chopped onions and peppers into the pot with the meat and mix.</li>
            <li>Add a full box of beef broth or about 32 ounces.</li>
            <li>Mix in 10.5 oz. can of Rotel tomatoes and green chilies and 10.75 oz. can of tomato puree.</li>
            <li>Mix it all up and let it cook for 30-45 minutes on medium heat, stir often.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Serve it up with some shredded real whole fat cheese and/or sour cream. And hopefully Enjoy.</p>
